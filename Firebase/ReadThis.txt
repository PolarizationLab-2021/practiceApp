Hey guys, it's a good idea to read this just to understand which files in this folder you should pay attention to.

the main file is App.js. It provides a demonstration of one of the applications of React Context
as well as a use of the useReducer and useMemo hooks. I'm iffy on those, so I'd check the docs for more info, but
anyway, useReducer works like useState, except the state variables tend to depend on their previous values. Honestly, I'm 
not sure what useMemo is good for. I'm just using it as a way to pass functions to Context, but I think I could do that without it?

I moved some of the App.js methods to authMethods to improve readability. You can find authMethods in /src/firebase.

Configuration information for both the app and our firebase project is in /serc/firebase/config.js.

/screens contains stylesheets and screen js files for each of the major screens in the project. I'd go through each of those to see 
how they use Context to interact with each other.
 
 I'm happy to go over the code and what I learned while writing it.
